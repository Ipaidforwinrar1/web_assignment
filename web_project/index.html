        <pre>
Once I was seven years old, my mama told me,
Go hit that playground, run hard, make friends and keep it healthy.
Once I was seven years old.

It was a big, big world, but I got even bigger,
Started with some push-ups, now my bench is getting slicker.
By eleven years old, my friends and I would race,
Who could run the fastest, who would finish in first place?

Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me,
Go lift those weights, stay strong, and eat your protein.
Once I was eleven years old.

I always had that dream, just like my coach before me,
So I started training early, kept that motivation on me.
By twenty years old, I hit my first 10K,
Running through the city, nothing standing in my way.

Soon I'll be thirty years old, still running every morning,
My body's feeling strong, and my energy's still soaring.
Soon I'll be thirty years old.

                <p>Bombardiro Crocodilo refers to a series of brainrot-style AI videos and memes of an anthropomorphic crocodile military bomber plane narrated by a male Italian text-to-speech voice that rhymes words similar to the Bitcoin Burger IbraTV French meme. The meme started in mid-February 2025 on TikTok, spawning other anthropomorphic characters, such as Bombombini Gusini, following the same rhyming text-to-speech soundbite jokes.</p>

                <img src="images/brr-brr-patapim.jpg">
                <p>Brr Brr Patapim refers to an AI-generated Italian Brainrot character that's a hybrid between a tree forest and a monkey with large feet. The meme became popular on TikTok and YouTube in late March 2025. Brr Brr Patapim was often powerscaled against Tung Tung Tung Sahur which was a similar brainrot character but from Indonesian meme creators. Other Italian Brainrot characters like Bombardiro Crocodilo and Tralalero Tralala predate Brr Brr Patapim.</p>

                <p>Tung Tung Tung Sahur is a series of brainrot-style AI videos and memes of an anthropomorphic wooden creature holding a baseball bat alongside an Indonesian voice-over. The meme is part of a series of brainrot memes from early 2025 in which a male Italian text-to-speech voice presents viewers with fantastical AI-generated creatures, like Bombardiro Crocodilo (an anthropomorphic crocodile military bomber plane) and Tralalero Tralala (a shark wearing Nike shoes). Tung Tung Tung Sahur was often powerscaled against Brr Brr Patapim (a monkey creature covered in trees and moss). Similar Indonesian brainrot characters like Hotspot Bro trended during the same timeframe. The meme may have been inspired by French Bitcoin Burger IbraTV videos with a similar text-to-speech word association style. In Indonesian and Malaysian culture, a large double-headed drum called a "bedug" is employed to signal prayer times and, during Ramadan, to announce Suhoor. "Tung tung tung" is onomatopoeia made to resemble the sound of the drum.</p>
