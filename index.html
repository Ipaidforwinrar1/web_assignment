        <pre>    Once I was seven years old, my mama told me,
Go hit that playground, run hard, make friends and keep it healthy.
Once I was seven years old.

It was a big, big world, but I got even bigger,
Started with some push-ups, now my bench is getting slicker.
By eleven years old, my friends and I would race,
Who could run the fastest, who would finish in first place?

Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me,
Go lift those weights, stay strong, and eat your protein.
Once I was eleven years old.

I always had that dream, just like my coach before me,
So I started training early, kept that motivation on me.
By twenty years old, I hit my first 10K,
Running through the city, nothing standing in my way.

Soon I'll be thirty years old, still running every morning,
My body's feeling strong, and my energy's still soaring.
Soon I'll be thirty years old.
